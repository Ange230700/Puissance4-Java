# Welcome to our Connect 4 Project !


# Explanations :

This project was created by second year students (3) of computer sciences. We had to make a connect 4 that is playable with 3 players, local or online !

The rules of connect4 are quite simple : it challenges the player to aling 4 pieces. You can align them horizontally, vertically, or in diagonals ! You can put a piece in the grid by choosing a specific column when it's your turn. The piece will fall down until there's something under them.  Other players should try to stop you from aligning them while trying to make their own line. The game is over when a player have successfully done a line. 🕹️


# Propriety : 

The project belongs to its authors. ✍️

- `KARSENTI Salomé` => salome.karsenti@ynov.com 👩‍🎓
- `KOUAKOU Ange` => ange.kouakou@ynov.com 👨‍🎓


# Used tools and technologies :

- Java 👨‍💻
- Maven 👨‍💻

# Instructions and Keys : 

- If you want to play in **local**, just enter the local number showed when you launch the game.
- If you want to play **online**, a player should choose to *host*. 
- The host will choose the room settings (number of players).
- Other players should join as *clients*.
- They'll have to enter the host's IP address, which should be shown to the host once he settled the room.

You'll now be connected to each other ! (the game will not start until there's a sufficient amount of player connected)

Is everything clear ? Alright ! 🎉

Final step... Enjoy ! 😄
